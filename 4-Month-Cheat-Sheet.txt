Question 2 : Write a program to calculate the sum of first n natural number.

Question 3 : Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then print the multiplication table of that number. 
	     Ex: 5 * 1 = 5
                 5 * 2 = 10 ... up to 10 terms

Question 4 : Write a program to find the factorial value of any number entered by the user as an input.

Question 10 : Print the sum of all factors of a number, 50 -> 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 + 25 = 43

Question 11 : Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. The numbers should be added and the sum displayed. 
              The loop should ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again. If so, the loop should repeat; 
              otherwise it should terminate.
